## Step 7: Create release v1.0.1

_One last step to go!_

### A final release

You updated the source code, but users can't readily access your most recent changes. Prepare a new release, and distribute that release to the necessary channels.

### Create release v1.0.1

With descriptive pull requests and auto generated release notes, you don't have to spend a lot of time working on your release draft. Follow the steps below to create your new release, generate the release notes, and publish.
